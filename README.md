# Kubo deployment

This repository contains automation scripts to deploy a [Kubernetes](https://kubernetes.io/) cluster using 

[BOSH](https://bosh.io/) within a [CloudFoundry](https://cloudfoundry.org) infrastructure.

## Glossary

- Kubo - Kubernetes on BOSH
- KuBOSH - BOSH with UAA, Credhub and PowerDNS
- [Bastion](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jump_server) - A server within the kubo network that provides secure access to kubo.
- BOSH Configuration - Folder that contains all configuration files needed to deploy KuBOSH, as well as all 
configuration files that are generated while deploying KuBOSH. Also called `<BOSH_ENV>`
- Environment Configuration and Environment Secrets - Configuration files that are used to deploy Kubo, these
are stored in `<BOSH_ENV>/director.yml` and `<BOSH_ENV>/director-secrets.yml`, respectively.
- Creds - Credentials that are generated by the KuBOSH deployment process and stored in `<BOSH_ENV>/creds.yml`
- Service - We will use the following terms to distinguish between different uses of the word "service"
  - [Service Instance](https://docs.cloudfoundry.org/devguide/services) - Cloud foundry services, which allow 
    provisioning of resources within a Cloud Foundry installation
  - [K8s service](https://kubernetes.io/docs/user-guide/services) - A logical collection of Kubernetes pods and
    a way to access them without needing information about the specific pods

# Required software

You'll need the following tools on your machine to continue:

- [bosh-cli](https://bosh.io/docs/cli-v2.html) for interacting with BOSH. Version 2.0.1 and above. Please ensure the binary is installed as `bosh-cli` and not `bosh`.
- [credhub cli](https://github.com/pivotal-cf/credhub-cli/releases/tag/0.4.0) for interacting with CredHub. Version 0.4 only.
- [Ruby 2.3+](https://www.ruby-lang.org/en/downloads) required by the bosh-cli to deploy KuBOSH
- [make](https://www.gnu.org/software/make) required by the bosh-cli to deploy KuBOSH

## Setup IAAS

For GCP: Check [here](https://github.com/cloudfoundry-incubator/bosh-google-cpi-release/tree/master/docs/bosh#configure-your-google-cloud-platform-environment) for instructions on how to setup GCP. Follow the steps included in the "Deploying Infrastructure" section to pave your GCP environment and to deploy a bastion VM using the provided Terraform script.

For other IAAS: Please follow the steps [here](https://bosh.io/docs/init.html). 

## Setup BOSH configuration files

## Generate environment configuration

The environment configuration can be generated using `bin/generate_env_config`.
It requires a path to a directory where the configuration will be stored, the name of the environment,
and the IaaS name.

It will create a directory with the same name as the environment at the specified path, containing three files:
- `iaas` which contains IaaS name
- `director.yml` which contains public BOSH director, IaaS and network configurations
- `director-secrets.yml` which contains sensitive configuration values, such as passwords and OAuth secrets

### Fill in configuration

The format for all configuration files is YAML. The main configuration is stored in a `director.yml` file. All
the properties have comments explaining their possible values and their purpose.

Refer to [ci/environments/gcp/director.yml](https://github.com/pivotal-cf-experimental/kubo-deployment/blob/master/ci/environments/gcp/director.yml) as an example.

## Deploy KuBOSH

### What is KuBOSH?

BOSH with integrated PowerDNS and CredHub. It is used to auto-generate certificates for kubelets.
You can generate certificate for kubelets manually and use them as part of deployment. In that case you can use
regular BOSH.

### Deployment process

When the environment preparation and configuration is completed, `KuBOSH` can be
easily deployed with a single command:

```bash
bin/deploy_bosh <path to configuration> <private or service account key filename for BOSH to use for deployments>

```

As a prerequisite, you will need to ensure that the machine you are running the command from has network access to the BOSH director. Else you may get the error

```
Command 'deploy' failed:
  Deploying:
    Creating instance 'bosh/0':
      Waiting until instance is ready:
        Sending ping to the agent:
          Performing request to agent endpoint 'https://mbus:294a691d057ede1af4f696aab36c4bc5@<bosh ip>:6868/agent':
            Performing POST request:
              Post https://mbus:294a691d057ede1af4f696aab36c4bc5@<bosh ip>:6868/agent: dial tcp <bosh ip>:6868: i/o timeout
```

There are multiple ways to ensure access. A couple of options are

1. Run the command from a Bastion VM you created previously as part of setup
1. Use [sshuttle](https://github.com/apenwarr/sshuttle) to create a tunnel to your bastion VM. Example for GCP:
```
sshuttle -r <Bastion IP address> <BOSH IP address>/32 # To establish a secure channel to the BOSH Director
```

During the deployment, all the passwords and SSL certificates will be automatically
generated. Most of them will be saved into the configuration path in a file called
`creds.yml`. Because this file will contain sensitive information, it is not recommended
to store it in a VCS. This file is also required to successfully deploy the kubernetes
service.

Subsequent runs of `bin/bosh_deploy` will apply changes made to the configuration
to an already existing KuBOSH installation, reusing the credentials stored in the `creds.yml`.

Another file that gets created during initial deployment is called `state.json`. It contains
the BOSH state identical to the one used by [bosh-init](https://bosh.io/docs/using-bosh-init.html).

Additionally, the deployment script creates the `default` CA certificate within CredHub.

## Deploy Cloud Foundry

Cloud Foundry deployment is not covered in this document. You can use an existing CF deployment you may have, or deploy using instructions.

To deploy open-source CF on GCP, follow the steps in this [deployment guide](https://github.com/cloudfoundry-incubator/bosh-google-cpi-release/tree/master/docs/cloudfoundry).

Please ensure that instances of your CF deployment are able to communicate with other deployments deployed via KuBOSH. This could simply mean deploying CF in the same network as K8s, or whitelisting traffic.

TCP router and the Routing API should be enabled on the Cloud Foundry installation. See [OSS CF](https://docs.cloudfoundry.org/adminguide/enabling-tcp-routing.html) or
[PCF](http://docs.pivotal.io/pivotalcf/1-8/opsguide/tcp-routing-ert-config.html) documentation for
further details.

A UAA client with [appropriate authorities](https://github.com/cloudfoundry-incubator/routing-api#configure-oauth-clients-manually-using-uaac-cli-for-uaa)
is required in order to register the TCP routes.

## Deploy Kubo

### The Easy Way: Automated

> #### Offline notes
> 
> By default, BOSH will try to install two additional releases: `etcd` and `docker-boshrelease`. The public URLs for
> these releases can be found at the top of the `manifests/service.yml` file. For offline deployment, these releases
> have to be deployed to BOSH from the local filesystem:
>  
> ```
> bosh-cli -e <BOSH director IP address> upload-release /path/to/release.tgz
> ```
> 
> Please note that the releases should be uploaded to BOSH before running the `bin/deploy_k8s` command.

Once KuBOSH is deployed, the Kubernetes BOSH release can be built and deployed with this command:

```bash
bin/deploy_k8s <BOSH_ENV> <DEPLOYMENT_NAME> <RELEASE_SOURCE>
```
Where:
- `<BOSH_ENV>` is the path to the BOSH configuration
- `<DEPLOYMENT_NAME>` is a unique name for the kubo deployment
- `<RELEASE_SOURCE>` **(optional)** Specifies which `kubo` BOSH release to use. The possible options are: `local`, `dev` and 
  `public` (default). Run `bin/deploy-k8s --help` for more details. 

Note that the scripts will:

- generate the CA certificate in CredHub
- upload any Cloud Config changes to the BOSH director
- upload the `kubo` release based on the `RELEASE_SOURCE` setting described above
- regenerate the kubo deployment manifest
- kick off the deployment using `bosh_admin` UAA client

By default, the deployment will use the latest versions of the releases. If releases were uploaded from different machines or
used different sources, deployment might use wrong release.

### The Hard Way: Step by Step

#### Generate Cloud Config

Kubo deployment uses [BOSH 2.0 Cloud Config](https://bosh.io/docs/cloud-config.html).

The default cloud config for GCP uses n1-standard-1 VMs for supporting services and n1-standard-2 VMs
for Kubernetes workers. The network properties are pulled in from the environment configuration file
which is stored at `<BOSH_ENV>/director.yml`.

Cloud config can be generated using following command:
```bash
bin/generate_cloud_config <BOSH_ENV>
```

##### Create and upload release

To create dev release, download the [kubo-release repository](https://github.com/pivotal-cf-experimental/kubo-release)
and follow [documentation](https://bosh.io/docs/create-release.html#dev-release)

##### Generate manifest

Manifest can be generated using command `bin/generate_service_manifest <BOSH_ENV> <DEPLOYMENT_NAME>`

##### Deploy

Run deployment using the following command: `bosh-cli -e <BOSH_ALIAS> -d <DEPLOYMENT_NAME> deploy <PATH to MANIFEST>`
where `<BOSH_ALIAS>` is BOSH director name from configuration file or BOSH director address

`bosh-cli` has to be authenticated to BOSH director

## Accessing Kubo

Configure kubectl for your Kubo instance with the following command:

```bash
bin/set_kubeconfig <BOSH_ENV> <DEPLOYMENT_NAME>
```

You can now issue kubectl commands such as:
```bash
kubectl get pods --namespace=kube-system
kubectl get nodes
```

## Development

This repo uses https://github.com/cloudfoundry/bosh-deployment as git subtree. Run command ` git subtree pull --prefix bosh-deployment git@github.com:cloudfoundry/bosh-deployment.git <ref>` to update subtree.
