# Kubo deployment

This repository contains automation scripts to deploy a [Kubernetes](https://kubernetes.io/) cluster using 

[BOSH](https://bosh.io/) within a [CloudFoundry](https://cloudfoundry.org) infrastructure.

## Glossary

- Kubo - Kubernetes on BOSH
- BOSH++ - BOSH with UAA, Credhub and PowerDNS
- BOSH Configuration - Folder that contains all configuration files needed to deploy BOSH++, as well as all 
configuration files that are generated while deploying BOSH++. Also called `<BOSH_ENV>`
- Environment Configuration and Environment Secrets - Configuration files that are used to deploy Kubo, these
are stored in `<BOSH_ENV>/director.yml` and `<BOSH_ENV>/director-secrets.yml`, respectively.
- Creds - Credentials that are generated by the BOSH++ deployment process and stored in `<BOSH_ENV>/creds.yml`
- Service - We will use the following terms to distinguish between different uses of the word "service"
  - [Service Instance](https://docs.cloudfoundry.org/devguide/services) - Cloud foundry services, which allow 
    provisioning of resources within a Cloud Foundry installation
  - [K8s service](https://kubernetes.io/docs/user-guide/services) - A logical collection of Kubernetes pods and
    a way to access them without needing information about the specific pods

# Required software

You'll need the following tools on your machine to continue:

- [bosh-cli](https://bosh.io/docs/cli-v2.html) for interacting with BOSH. Version 2.0.1 and above. Please ensure the binary is installed as `bosh-cli` and not `bosh`.
- [credhub cli](https://github.com/pivotal-cf/credhub-cli/releases/tag/0.4.0) for interacting with CredHub. Version 0.4 only.
- [Ruby 2.3+](https://www.ruby-lang.org/en/downloads) required by the bosh-cli to deploy BOSH++
- [make](https://www.gnu.org/software/make) required by the bosh-cli to deploy BOSH++

# Installation steps

Here is an overview of the steps you would need to take in order to get a running cluster

1. [Setup IAAS](#Setup-IAAS)
1. [Setup BOSH configuration files](#Setup-BOSH-configuration-files)
1. [Deploy BOSH++](#Deploy-BOSH++)
1. [Deploy CF](#Cloud-Foundry)
1. [Deploy K8s](#Deploy-Kubo)
1. Push your app!

## Setup IAAS

For GCP: Check [here](https://github.com/cloudfoundry-incubator/bosh-google-cpi-release/tree/master/docs/bosh#configure-your-google-cloud-platform-environment) for instructions on how to setup GCP. Follow the steps included in the "Deploying Infrastructure" section to pave your GCP environment and to deploy a bastion VM using the provided Terraform script.

For other IAAS: Please follow the steps [here](https://bosh.io/docs/init.html) for all other IAASes. 

## Setup BOSH configuration files

## Generate environment configuration

The environment configuration can be generated using `bin/generate_env_config`.
It requires a path to a directory where the configuration will be stored, the name of the environment,
and the IaaS name.

It will create a directory with the same name as the environment at the specified path, containing three files:
- `iaas` which contains IaaS name
- `director.yml` which contains public BOSH director, IaaS and network configurations
- `director-secrets.yml` which contains secret configuration values, such as passwords and OAuth secrets

### Fill in configuration

The format for all configuration files is YAML. The main configuration is stored in a `director.yml` file. All
the properties have comments explaining their possible values and their purpose.

Refer to `ci/environments/gcp/director.yml` as an example.

## Deploy BOSH++

### What is BOSH++?

BOSH with integrated PowerDNS and CredHub. It is used to auto-generate certificates for kubelets.
You can generate certificate for kubelets manually and use them as part of deployment. In that case you can use
regular BOSH.

### Deployment process

When the environment preparation and configuration is completed, `BOSH++` can be
easily deployed with a single command:

```bash
bin/deploy_bosh <path to configuration> <private or service account key filename for BOSH to use for deployments>

```

As a pre-requisite, you will need to ensure that the machine you are running the command from has network access to the BOSH director. Else you may get the error

```
Command 'deploy' failed:
  Deploying:
    Creating instance 'bosh/0':
      Waiting until instance is ready:
        Sending ping to the agent:
          Performing request to agent endpoint 'https://mbus:294a691d057ede1af4f696aab36c4bc5@<bosh ip>:6868/agent':
            Performing POST request:
              Post https://mbus:294a691d057ede1af4f696aab36c4bc5@<bosh ip>:6868/agent: dial tcp <bosh ip>:6868: i/o timeout
```

There are multiple ways to ensure access. A couple of options are

1. Run the command from a Bastion VM you created previously as part of setup
1. Use [sshuttle](https://github.com/apenwarr/sshuttle) to create a tunnel to your bastion VM. Example for GCP:
```
sshuttle -r "${BOSH_ENV}-bosh-bastion.${GCP_ZONE}.${GCP_PROJECT_ID}" ${BOSH_SUBNET_CIDR_RANGE} # To establish a secure channel into the BOSH++ network
```

During the deployment, all the passwords and SSL certificates will be automatically
generated. Most of them will be saved into the configuration path in a file called
`creds.yml`. Because this file will contain sensitive information, it is not recommended
to store it in a VCS. This file is also required to successfully deploy the kubernetes
service or the on-demand broker.

Subsequent runs of `bin/bosh_deploy` will apply changes made to the configuration
to an already existing BOSH++ installation, reusing the credentials stored in the `creds.yml`.

Another file that gets created during initial deployment is called `state.json`. It contains
the BOSH state identical to the one used by [bosh-init](https://bosh.io/docs/using-bosh-init.html).

Additionally, the deployment script creates the `default` CA certificate within CredHub.

## Deploy Cloud Foundry

Cloud Foundry deployment is not covered in this document. You can use an existing CF deployment you may have, or deploy using instructions.

To deploy open-source CF on GCP, follow the steps in this [deployment guide](https://github.com/cloudfoundry-incubator/bosh-google-cpi-release/tree/master/docs/cloudfoundry).

Please ensure that instances of your CF deployment are able to communicate with other deployments deployed via BOSH++. This could simply mean deploying CF in the same network as K8s, or whitelisting traffic.

TCP router and the Routing API should be enabled on the Cloud Foundry installation. See [OSS CF](https://docs.cloudfoundry.org/adminguide/enabling-tcp-routing.html) or
[PCF](http://docs.pivotal.io/pivotalcf/1-8/opsguide/tcp-routing-ert-config.html) documentation for
further details.

A UAA client with [appropriate authorities](https://github.com/cloudfoundry-incubator/routing-api#configure-oauth-clients-manually-using-uaac-cli-for-uaa)
is required in order to register the TCP routes.

## Deploy Kubo

### The Easy Way: Automated

Once BOSH++ is deployed, the Kubernetes BOSH release can be built and deployed with this command:

```bash
bin/deploy_k8s <BOSH_ENV> <DEPLOYMENT_NAME> <RELEASE_SOURCE>
```

The `RELEASE_SOURCE` parameter allows you to either build and deploy a local copy of the repository, or deploy our pre-built kubo-release tarball, and is optional.

Note that the scripts will:

- Generate certificate in CredHub
- upload any Cloud Config changes to the director
- create the kubo release from source and upload it if RELEASE_SOURCE is dev
or
- upload the kubo release tarball from specified location if RELEASE_SOURCE is local
- regenerate the deployment manifest
- kick off the deployment using `bosh_admin` UAA client

By default, the deployment will use the latest versions of the releases. If releases were uploaded from different machines or
used different sources, deployment might use wrong release.

### The Hard Way: Step by Step

#### Generate Cloud Config

Kubo deployment uses [BOSH 2.0 Cloud Config](https://bosh.io/docs/cloud-config.html).

The default cloud config for GCP uses n1-standard-1 VMs for supporting services and n1-standard-2 VMs
for Kubernetes workers. The network properties are pulled in from the environment configuration file
which is stored at `<BOSH_ENV>/director.yml`.

Cloud config can be generated using following command:
```bash
bin/generate_cloud_config <BOSH_ENV>
```

##### Create and upload release

To create dev release, download the [kubo-release repository](https://github.com/pivotal-cf-experimental/kubo-release)
and follow [documentation](https://bosh.io/docs/create-release.html#dev-release)

##### Generate manifest

Manifest can be generated using command `bin/generate_service_manifest <BOSH_ENV> <DEPLOYMENT_NAME>`

##### Deploy

Run deployment using the following command: `bosh-cli -e <BOSH_ALIAS> -d <DEPLOYMENT_NAME> deploy <PATH to MANIFEST>`
where `<BOSH_ALIAS>` is BOSH director name from configuration file or BOSH director address

`bosh-cli` has to be authenticated to BOSH director

## Accessing Kubo

Configure kubectl for your Kubo instance with the following command:

```bash
bin/set_kubeconfig <BOSH_ENV> <DEPLOYMENT_NAME>
```

You can now issue kubectl commands such as:
```bash
kubectl get pods --namespace=kube-system
kubectl get nodes
```

## Development

This repo uses https://github.com/cloudfoundry/bosh-deployment as git subtree. Run command ` git subtree pull --prefix bosh-deployment git@github.com:cloudfoundry/bosh-deployment.git <ref>` to update subtree.
