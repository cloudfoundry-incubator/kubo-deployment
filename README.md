## Glossary

- Kubo - Kubernetes on BOSH
- KuBOSH - BOSH with UAA, Credhub and PowerDNS
- [Bastion](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jump_server) - A server within the kubo network that provides secure access to kubo.
- BOSH Configuration - Folder that contains all configuration files needed to deploy KuBOSH, as well as all 
configuration files that are generated while deploying KuBOSH. Also called `<BOSH_ENV>`
- Environment Configuration and Environment Secrets - Configuration files that are used to deploy Kubo, these
are stored in `<BOSH_ENV>/director.yml` and `<BOSH_ENV>/director-secrets.yml`, respectively.
- Creds - Credentials that are generated by the KuBOSH deployment process and stored in `<BOSH_ENV>/creds.yml`
- Service - We will use the following terms to distinguish between different uses of the word "service"
  - [Service Instance](https://docs.cloudfoundry.org/devguide/services) - Cloud foundry services, which allow 
    provisioning of resources within a Cloud Foundry installation
  - [K8s service](https://kubernetes.io/docs/user-guide/services) - A logical collection of Kubernetes pods and
    a way to access them without needing information about the specific pods
