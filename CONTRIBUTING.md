## Contributor Workflow
We encourage contributors to have discussion around design and implmentation with team members before making significant changes to the project through [GitHub Issues](https://github.com/cloudfoundry-incubator/kubo-deployment/issues). The project manager will prioritize where the feature will fit into the project's road map.

1. Fork the project on [GitHub](https://github.com/cloudfoundry-incubator/kubo-deployment)
1. Create a feature branch.
1. Make your feature addition or bug fix. Please make sure there is appropriate test coverage.
1. Run at least operation file [tests](#running-tests).
1. Ensure your feature branch is up to date with `master` branch.
1. Submit a pull request with clear description of intended change.
1. The team will triage the pull request and assign it to a team member.
1. A team member will approve the pull request or make suggestions for changes.

## Running Tests

### Manifest Operation file tests

CFCR contains special tests to verify if Operation files were documented and that it is possible to apply each operation file to the manifest.
The tests require only Bosh CLI.

1. Run `./bin/run_tests`

### Smoke test

Follow the steps below to deploy and test kubernetes BOSH deployment. This test verifies the basic functionality is not broken.

1. Deploy a Kubernetes cluster.
1. [Deploy a workload](https://kubernetes.io/docs/tasks/run-application/run-stateless-application-deployment/) on the cluster.
1. Run `smoke-tests` errand.

### Conformance tests

Follow the steps below to test your cluster against the [certified Kubernetes](https://github.com/cncf/k8s-conformance) conformance tests.  The instructions differ from the official kubernetes instructions and allow the tests to be run in parallel.  In order to submit to the Certified Kubernetes programme, you will have to follow the official instructions.

#### Running tests using CFCR Docker file

You can run Conformance tests using Docker file, it is much faster, but can be flaky.

1. `docker run -it --rm --mount type=bind,source="${HOME}/.kube/config",target="/kubeconfig" pcfkubo/conformance:stable /bin/bash`
1. `ginkgo -p -progress -focus  "\[Conformance\]" -skip "\[Serial\]" /e2e.test`
1. `ginkgo -focus="\[Serial\].*\[Conformance\]" /e2e.test`

### Integration tests

Follow [Kubo release instructions](https://github.com/cloudfoundry-incubator/kubo-release/blob/master/CONTRIBUTING.md#integration-tests). Integration tests require some custom configurations, feel free to contact us if not all tests are passing.

#### Prerequisites

Ensure you have a CFCR cluster and a Kubeconfig file.  The following instructions assume your Kubeconfig file is located at `${HOME}/.kube/config`.
