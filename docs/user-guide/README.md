# Kubo user guide

## Infrastructure paving
Kubo can be deployed on various infrastructure providers. The currently supported ones 
are GCP and vSphere. vSphere installation is not yet covered in this guide. 

Please follow the link for infrastructure paving on your platform:
- [Google Cloud Platform](platforms/gcp/paving.md)

## Deploying BOSH

- [Google Cloud Platform](platforms/gcp/install-bosh.md)

## Configure Kubo

### Create a Kubo environment

A Kubo environment is a set of configuration files used to deploy and update 
both BOSH and Kubo. 

Run `./bin/generate_env_config <ENV_PATH> <ENV_NAME> gcp` to generate a Kubo
environment. The environment will be referred to as `KUBO_ENV` in this guide,
and will be located at `<ENV_PATH>/<ENV_NAME>`. 

> Run `bin/generate_env_config --help` for more detailed information.

### Routing options

Kubo can leverage different routing options to improve security and high
availability of the cluster. Please configure the kubo environment according
to one of the options below:

- [IaaS Load-Balancing](routing/gcp/load-balancing.md)
- [CF Routing](routing/cf.md)

### Basic configuration

To view an adjust the available configuration options, please edit the `<KUBO_ENV>/director.yml` file that
was created as part of the [routing options setup](#create-a-kubo-environment).

### Proxy settings

The following variables can be configured in the director.yml to allow Docker have proxy access:

```yaml
http_proxy: # e.g. http://my.proxy.local:73636
https_proxy: # e.g. https://secure.proxy.local:5566
no_proxy: # e.g. '1.2.3.4,2.3.4.5'
```

## Deploying Kubo

Once the infrastructure has been set up, a kubernetes cluster can be deployed by running a single line of code:

   ```bash
   bin/deploy_k8s <KUBO_ENV> <CLUSTER_NAME>
   ```
    
where `CLUSTER_NAME` is a unique name for the cluster. Run `bin/deploy_k8s --help` for more options.

### Customized deployment

The `kubo-deployment` provides a number of ways to customize the kubo settings. Please follow the 
[custom install guide](customized-kubo-installation.md) if you need to change the default behaviour.

## Accessing Kubernetes


### Operator access
Once the cluster is deployed, setup `kubectl` and access your new Kubernetes cluster
   
   ```bash
   bin/set_kubeconfig <KUBO_ENV> <CLUSTER_NAME>
   ```

To verify that the settings have been applied correctly, run the following command:

   ```bash
   kubectl get pods --namespace=kube-system
   ```
   
### Enabling application access

Different routing modes provide different ways of exposing applications run by the Kubernetes cluster:

- [IaaS routing](./routing/exposing-apps.md)
- [CF routing](./routing/cf-apps.md)

## Troubleshooting

See [troubleshooting section](troubleshooting.md) for solutions to most commonly encountered problems.
