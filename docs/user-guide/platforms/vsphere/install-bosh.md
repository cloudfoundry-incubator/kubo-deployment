# Deploying BOSH for KUBO on vSphere

**Prerequisite:** The machine executing the commands below must be able to access VMs on the vSphere network.
Depending on your network topology, a bastion host (jumpbox) may be needed.

1. Clone the kubo-deployment repo and change directory into it.

    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/cloudfoundry-incubator/kubo-deployment
    cd kubo-deployment
    ```

1. Create a kubo environment to set the configuration for BOSH and Kubo.

    ```bash
    export kubo_env=~/kubo-env
    export kubo_env_name=kubo
    export kubo_env_path="${kubo_env}/${kubo_env_name}"

    mkdir -p "${kubo_env}"
    ./bin/generate_env_config "${kubo_env}" ${kubo_env_name} vsphere
    ```

    The `kubo_env_path` will point to the folder containing the Kubo settings,
    and will be referred to throughout this guide as `KUBO_ENV`.

1.  Populate the environment config skeleton created at `${kubo_env_path}/director.yml`
    Fill the vSphere user password in the `${kubo_env_path}/director-secrets.yml`.
    Make sure not to check that file into the VCS.

1. Deploy a BOSH director for Kubo

    ```bash
    ./bin/deploy_bosh "${kubo_env_path}"
    ```
    Credentials and SSL certificates for the environment will be generated and
    saved into the configuration path in a file called `creds.yml`. This file
    contains sensitive information and should not be stored in VCS. The file
    `state.json` contains
    [environment state for the BOSH environment](https://bosh.io/docs/cli-envs.html#deployment-state).

    Subsequent runs of `bin/bosh_deploy` will apply changes made to
    the configuration to an already existing BOSH installation, reusing
    the credentials stored in the `creds.yml`.
